# 12_days_of_christmas
A program that calculates the gifts accumulated during the song "12 Days of Christmas."

During Christmas 2018, I started to wonder how many total gifts were accumulated during the song "12 Days of Christmas." Which gift was there ultimately the most off? So I made this program.

This is one is iterative. Surely you could make a recursive one too.

```12 partridges in a pear tree
22 turtle doves
30 French hens
36 calling birds
40 golden rings
42 geese a-laying
42 swans a-swimming
40 maids a-milking
36 ladies dancing
30 lords a-leaping
22 pipers piping
12 drummers drumming```
